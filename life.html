        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>Prague, Czech Praha, city, capital of the Czech Republic. Lying at the heart of Europe, it is one of the continent’s finest cities and the major Czech economic and cultural centre. The city has a rich architectural heritage that reflects both the uncertain currents of history in Bohemia and an urban life extending back more than 1,000 years.There are numerous physical sights and monuments in Prague. The Charles Bridge (Karlv most), which spans the Vltava River, is one of the most beautiful. The Vltava's twisting course, with its series of bridges and shifting vistas, coincides with the ever-present backdrop of Hradany (Prague Castle), which occupies the city's left-bank area from behind huge walls perched high on a hill. The older quarters' narrow streets and small taverns and restaurants contrast with Wenceslas Square's vast sweep and new parks and housing projects, whereas the great 18th-century Baroque palaces have their own beauty and splendour. The many church towers provide a unique viewpoint when seen from the surrounding hills, earning Prague the nickname "town of a hundred spires." Post-1945 planning aided this architectural balance by preserving the city's historic center as a major landmark and closely monitoring all new construction. The historic city center was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1992.Prague is known for its vibrant cultural scene. Mozart lived in the area, and it was there that his Prague Symphony and Don Giovanni were first performed. In addition, a spring music festival honors the lyric music of Bedich Smetana, Antonn Dvoák, and Leo Janáek, three great Czech composers. The humorously antiauthoritarian activities of Schweik, immortalized by novelist Jaroslav Haek in The Good Soldier Schweik, took place at the U kalicha (“At the Chalice”) beer parlour, which is still famous with locals and tourists alike.  Franz Kafka's writings, which focus on the dilemmas and predicaments of everyday life in an unique way, also seem inextricably linked to life in this area.

        <h1>PEOPLE</h1>
        <p>Prague is a city with a very homogenous society. There is a tiny Slovak minority, but Czechs make up the vast majority of the population. The city has a variety of demographic peculiarities, most of which derive from World War II's effects; there are more women than men, and a significant portion of the female population is past reproductive age. The natural rate of population growth is extremely slow. Smaller families are becoming more common as a result of housing shortages and increased involvement in the workforce by both parents. The influx of people into the city has persisted.
